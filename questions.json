Throw preemptible VMs at fault-tolerant workloads such as high performance computing, big data and analytics, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), rendering/transcoding, and testing.\nGet more from your containers\nContainers are naturally stateless and fault tolerant, making them a great fit for preemptible VMs! You save on your containerized workloads today with these affordable compute instances. Take advantage of Google Kubernetes Engine for your containerized workloads and Managed Instance Groups to painlessly and seamlessly recover from preemptions.\nEnable it instantly\nSimply add --preemptible to the gcloud command line and you're off to the races.

Like the captain is responsible for the safe journey of the ship in the seas, Kubernetes is responsible for carrying and delivering those boxes safely to locations where they can be used.\n-\tKubernetes can be used with or without Docker.\n-\tDocker is not an alternative to Kubernetes, so it\u2019s less of a \u201cKubernetes vs. Docker\u201d question.

You can use a public image, a custom image, or a snapshot that was taken from another boot disk. When you create a boot disk, limit the disk size to 2 TB to account for the limitations of MBR partitioning.\nCompute Engine automatically creates a boot persistent disk when you create an instance. If you require additional data storage space for your instances, add one or more secondary instance storage options.\nYou might need to create a standalone boot persistent disk and attach it to an instance later, or resize a boot persistent disk to improve performance and add more space for additional applications or operating system files. That process is described in Add or resize a persistent disk.\nAs a best practice, do not use regional persistent disks for boot disks. In a failover situation, they do not force-attach to a VM.\nAfter you create a snapshot of a boot persistent disk, you can apply data from that snapshot to new persistent disks. It is only possible to apply data from a snapshot when you first create a persistent disk. You cannot apply a snapshot to an existing persistent disk, or apply a snapshot to persistent disks that belong to a different project than that snapshot."

Bigtable handles and manages this encryption for you without any additional action on your part.\nIf you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you can use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for BigTable. Instead of Google managing the encryption keys that protect your data, your BigTable instance is protected using a key that you control and manage in Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).\nFeatures\nSecurity: CMEK provides the same level of security as Google's default encryption but provides more administrative control.\nData access control: Administrators can rotate, manage access to, and disable or destroy the key used to protect data at rest in BigTable .\nAuditability: All actions on your CMEK keys are logged and viewable in Cloud Logging. Comparable performance: BigTable CMEK-protected instances offer comparable performance to BigTable instances that use Google default encryption.\nFlexibility: You can use the same CMEK key in multiple projects or instances or you can use separate keys, depending on your business needs."

        "explanation": "Reference: https://cloud.google.com/bigtable\nCloud Bigtable is a sparsely populated table that can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns, enabling you to store terabytes or even petabytes of data. A single value in each row is indexed; this value is known as the row key. Bigtable is ideal for storing very large amounts of single-keyed data with very low latency. It supports high read and write throughput at low latency, and it is an ideal data source for MapReduce operations.\nBigtable is exposed to applications through multiple client libraries, including a supported extension to the Apache HBase library for Java. As a result, it integrates with the existing Apache ecosystem of open-source Big Data software.\nBigtable's powerful back-end servers offer several key advantages over a self-managed HBase installation:\nIncredible scalability. Bigtable scales in direct proportion to the number of machines in\nyour cluster. A self-managed HBase installation has a design bottleneck that limits the performance after a certain threshold is reached. Bigtable does not have this bottleneck, so you can scale your cluster up to handle more reads and writes.\nSimple administration. Bigtable handles upgrades and restarts transparently, and it automatically maintains high data durability. To replicate your data, simply add a second cluster to your instance, and replication starts automatically. No more managing replicas or regions; just design your table schemas, and Bigtable will handle the rest for you.\nCluster resizing without downtime. You can increase the size of a Bigtable cluster for a few hours to handle a large load, then reduce the cluster's size again\u2014all without any downtime. After you change a cluster's size, it typically takes just a few minutes under load for Bigtable to balance performance across all of the nodes in your cluster.\nGraphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated"

Enterprises must purchase equipment through procurement processes that can take months. They must invest in physical spaces: typically specialized rooms with power and cooling. And after deploying the systems, enterprises need IT, professionals, to manage them.\nAll this is challenging to scale when demand spikes or the business grows. Enterprises risk running out of capacity or overbuilding and ending up with infrastructure that suffers from low utilization.\nThese challenges are why IaaS use is steadily growing.
